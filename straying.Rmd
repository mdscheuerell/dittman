# Trends in time series

Trends in time series can be estimated via simple linear regression where, for a value $x$ measured at time $t$,

$$
x_t = \alpha + \beta t + \epsilon_t.
$$

However, any estimates of the significance of $\alpha$ or $\beta$ will be biased due to non-independence in the observation errors $\epsilon_t$.

Another alternative is to assume the observations follow a so-called "biased random walk". In a normal random walk, the value at time $t$ equals that at time $t-1$ plus or minus some random error. Specifically,

\begin{equation} \label{eqnRW}
x_t = x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t.
\end{equation}

Random walks are characterized by long deviations into positive or negative space, but there is no overall tendency to go up or down.

set.seed(123)
ww <- rnorm(50)
xx <- cumsum(ww)
plot.ts(ww)
